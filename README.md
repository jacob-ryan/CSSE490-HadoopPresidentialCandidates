# CSSE490-HadoopPresidentialCandidates
CSSE 490 - Intro to the Hadoop Ecosystem - Presidential candidates project (Jacob, Collin, and Nithin)

The presidential candidates project was designed to let users view different statistics regarding presidential candidates for the 2016 presidential race.  Users can also filter and look for specific data via the developed web interface.

Commits don't entirely reflect the work done on this project as a majority of the parts done by ctrokid and NithinPerumal were pair programmed but committed from ctrokid's github account due to technical issues.

Therefore, I will list the contributions made by the Nithin Perumal based on their contributions:

Nithin Perumal - Contributed code to the Topology - the overall design for data flow in different parts of the project. Helped to design and contribute to the data importing tool that allowed the application to import data using twitter api's.  Contributed the code that aggregated retweets using the MapReduce framework and used Storm analyse live twitter data.  The storm parts were pairprogrammed with ctrokid.
